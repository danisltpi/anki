# as::dynamic-static-analysis

## dynamic analysis

- also called run-time analysis
- run the program
- check for bad behavior

## static analysis

- analysation at compile time
- build an approximation of program's behavior
- check whether approximation satisfies some properties

## examples of static program analysis

- type checking
- data race analysis
  - prone to overapproximation -> false positives
